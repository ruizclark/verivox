            VERIVOX was launched in 2025 as a space to amplify the voices of current and former candidates of the
            Doctoral program in Education Leadership (EdLD) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). 
            VERIVOX is a student-led initiative, operating independently of HGSE. As a volunteer-run platform, VERIVOX 
            does not receive financial support, sponsorship, or official endorsement from Harvard University. 
            The views expressed on the platform are solely those of our members, and do not necessarily reflect 
            the opinions of VERIVOX’s founders or of HGSE.
